## General info
When analytical arguments are intractable, a popular way to learn about the finite-sample
properties of estimators is by Monte Carlo simulation. The objective is to approximate the
sampling distribution of an estimator by generating some large number independent data
sets from a known situation and computing the estimator for each data set.
